# advent-of-code-2020
 Learning Rust and my excuse is advent of code this year

The code in this is probably going to be very inefficient and very dirty.  Advent of Code is all about speed of problem completion and I'm learning Rust on the fly right now, so I'm not focusing on optimization.  That may come if I ever revisit this code and make it better (I probably won't :) ).
